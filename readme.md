# Programming Language Concepts

A work through the book Programming Language Concepts by Peter Sestoft.

The website for the book is located at: [https://studwww.itu.dk/~sestoft/plc/](https://studwww.itu.dk/~sestoft/plc/).

## Example code and exercises

Some example code from the website is included, when used for exercises, etc.

Included example code is likely modified to some degree, though the original header is always preserved.
By this I mean any example code will retain leading comments.
For example, `Intro/Intro1.fs` retains:

``` f#

```

Though, most examples from the file have been recast as tests.

## Tests

Some example code is recast as tests, and I expect at least minimal tests to accompany the exercises.

Tests can be run via:

``` shell
cd ./ProgrammingLanguageConcepts.Tests/
dotnet test
```
